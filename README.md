Domestically-chartered banks regulated by the FDIC are required to file quarterly financial reports to regulators, known colloquially as "[call reports](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_report)". This data is made publically available [by the FFIEC](https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/) but is difficult to download efficiently and hard to analyze in aggregate.

This project aims to simplify data access and open up new methods for analysis.
